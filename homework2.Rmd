## 1. Cancer Research in Laboratory Mice

A laboratory is estimating the rate of tumorigenesis (the formation of tumors) in two strains of mice, A and B.  They have tumor count data for 10 mice in strain A and 13 mice in strain B.  Type A mice have been well studied, and information from other laboratories suggests that type A mice have tumor counts that are approximately Poisson-distributed. Tumor count rates for type B mice are unknown, but type B mice are related to type A mice. Assuming a Poisson sampling distribution for each group with rates $\theta_A$ and $\theta_B$. Based on previous research you settle on the following prior distribution:

$$ \theta_A \sim \text{gamma}(120, 10),\ \theta_B\sim\text{gamma}(12, 1)$$ 

**1a.** Before seeing any data, which group do you expect to have a higher average incidence of cancer?  Which group are you more certain about a priori? You answers should be based on the priors specified above.
    

I would expect both A and B to have around the same average. This is because the expected value of a gamma is a/b being 120/10=12 for A and 12/1=12 aswell for B.

I am more certain about a priori for group A because it has a lower variance. The variance for a gamma distribution is a/b^2, 1.2 for A and 12 for B
    
**1b.**  After you the complete of the experiment, you  observe the following tumor counts for the two populations: 

$$y_A = (12,9,12,14,13,13,15,8,15,6)$$
$$y_B = (11,11,10,9,9,8,7,10,6,8,8,9,7)$$
    
Compute the posterior parameters, posterior means, posterior variances and 95% quantile-based credible intervals for $\theta_A$ and $\theta_B$.  Same them in the appropriate variables in the code cell below.  You do not need to show your work, but you cannot get partial credit unless you do show work.

```{r summary_stats, echo=FALSE}
yA <- c(12, 9, 12, 14, 13, 13, 15, 8, 15, 6)
yB <- c(11, 11, 10, 9, 9, 8, 7, 10, 6, 8, 8, 9, 7)

# Prior parameters here
alpha_A = 120
beta_A = 10

alpha_B = 12
beta_B = 1

# Posterior parameters here
alpha_A_posterior = alpha_A+sum(yA)
beta_A_posterior = beta_B+length(yA)

alpha_B_posterior = alpha_B+sum(yB)
beta_B_posterior = beta_B+length(yB)
            
## Posterior mean and variance for each group        
A_post_mean <- alpha_A_posterior/beta_A_posterior
A_post_var <- alpha_A_posterior/((beta_A_posterior)^2)

# Posterior quantiles for each group
B_post_mean <- alpha_B_posterior/beta_B_posterior
B_post_var <- alpha_B_posterior/((beta_B_posterior)^2)

print(paste0("Posterior mean of theta_A ", round(A_post_mean, 2)))
print(paste0("Posterior variance of theta_A ", round(A_post_var, 2)))
print(paste0("Posterior mean of theta_B ", round(B_post_mean, 2)))
print(paste0("Posterior variance of theta_B ", round(B_post_var, 2)))

# Posterior quantiles
alpha_A_quantile <- qbeta(c(0.25,0.975),alpha_A_posterior,beta_A_posterior)
alpha_B_quantile <- qbeta(c(0.25,0.975),alpha_B_posterior,beta_B_posterior)

print(paste0("Posterior 95% quantile for theta_A is [", round(alpha_A_quantile[1],2), ", ", round(alpha_A_quantile[2], 2), "]"))
print(paste0("Posterior 95% quantile for theta_B is [", round(alpha_B_quantile[1],2), ", ", round(alpha_B_quantile[2], 2), "]"))
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q1b.R")
```


        
**1c.** Compute and plot the posterior expectation of $\theta_B$ given $y_B$ under the prior distribution  $\text{gamma}(12\times n_0, n_0)$ for each value of $n_0 \in \{1,2,...,50\}$. As a reminder, $n_0$ can be thought of as the number of prior observations (or pseudo-counts).  

```{r}

n0 <- c(1:50)
alpha_b2 <- 12*n0
beta_b2 <- n0
alpha_b_pos2 <- sum(yB)+alpha_b2
beta_b_pos2 <- 13+beta_b2

posterior_means = alpha_b_pos2/beta_b_pos2

plot(n0,posterior_means,xlab='Prior Observations',ylab='Posterior Expectation')
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q1c.R")
```



**1d.** Should knowledge about population A tell us anything about population B? Discuss whether or not it makes sense to have $p(\theta_A, \theta_B) = p(\theta_A) \times p(\theta_B)$.  

The mice in population B are said to be related to those in population A so knowledge about population A could help us make a guess about population B but the two are independent statistically. The tumore count in population A does not affect that of population B so yes, it does make sense to have $p(\theta_A, \theta_B) = p(\theta_A) \times p(\theta_B)$

## 2. A Mixture Prior for Heart Transplant Surgeries

A hospital in the United States wants to evaluate their success rate of heart transplant surgeries.  We observe the number of deaths, $y$, in a number of heart transplant surgeries. Let $y \sim \text{Pois}(\nu\lambda)$ where $\lambda$ is the rate of deaths/patient and $\nu$ is the exposure (total number of heart transplant patients).  When measuring rare events with low rates, maximum likelihood estimation can be notoriously bad.  We'll tak a Bayesian approach.  To construct your prior distribution you talk to two experts.  The first expert thinks that $p_1(\lambda)$ with a \text{gamma}(3, 2000)$ density is a reasonable prior. The second expert thinks that $p_2(\lambda)$ with a $\text{gamma}(7, 1000)$ density is a reasonable prior distribution.  You decide that each expert is equally credible so you combine their prior distributions into a mixture prior with equal weights: $p(\lambda) = 0.5 * p_1(\lambda) + 0.5 * p_2(\lambda)$

**2a.** What does each expert think the mean rate is, _a priori_? Which expert is more confident about the value of $\lambda$ a priori (i.e. before seeing any data)?
    
Expert 1 believed the mean rate is 3/2000 = 0.0015 and Expert 2 thinks the mean rate is 7/1000 = 0.007. Expert 1 is more confident about the value of $\lambda$ a priori because there is a smaller variance in his believed density. Expert 1 has a variance of 3/4,000,000 and Expert 2 has a variance of 7/1,000,000.

**2b.** Plot the mixture prior distribution.

```{r}
lambda <- seq(0,.02,0.001)
mixture_prior <- (0.5*dgamma(lambda,3,2000)+0.5*dgamma(lambda,7,1000))
qplot(lambda,mixture_prior,geom='line',xlab='Lambda',ylab='Density')

```

        
    
**2c.** Suppose the hospital has $y=8$ deaths with an exposure of $\nu=1767$ surgeries performed.  Write the posterior distribution up to a proportionality constant by multiplying the likelihood and the prior density.  _Warning:_ be very careful about what constitutes a proportionality constant in this example.    
    
$P(\lambda|y=8) \propto L(\lambda)P(\lambda)$

$\propto P(y=8|\nu\lambda)(0.5p_1(\lambda)+0.5p_2(\lambda))$

gamma:
$f(\lambda,\alpha,\beta)=\frac{\beta^\alpha\lambda^{\alpha-1}e^{-\beta\lambda}}{\gamma(\alpha)}$

poisson:
$P(Y=y)=\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^y}{y!}$ 
$=\frac{e^{-\nu\lambda}\nu\lambda^8}{8!}$

$P(\lambda|y=8) \propto \frac{e^{-\nu\lambda}(\nu\lambda)^8}{8!}*0.5(\frac{2000^3\lambda^{3-1}e^{-2000\lambda}}{\Gamma(3)}+\frac{1000^7\lambda^{7-1}e^{-1000\lambda}}{\Gamma(7)})$

$\propto e^{-\nu\lambda}(\nu\lambda)^8(\frac{2000^3\lambda^2e^{-2000\lambda}}{\Gamma(3)}+\frac{1000^7\lambda^6e^{-1000\lambda}}{\Gamma(7)})$

$\propto e^{-1767\lambda}(1767\lambda)^8(\frac{2000^3\lambda^2e^{-2000\lambda}}{\Gamma(3)}+\frac{1000^7\lambda^6e^{-1000\lambda}}{\Gamma(7)})$

Factor out constants:
$e^{-1767\lambda}1767^8\lambda^8(\frac{2000^3\lambda^2e^{-2000\lambda}}{2!}+\frac{1000^7\lambda^6e^{-1000\lambda}}{6!})$

Remove first constant and continue to simplify: $e^{-1767\lambda}\lambda^8(\frac{2^{12}*5^{9}\lambda^2e^{-2000\lambda}}{2}+\frac{2^{21}*5^{21}\lambda^6e^{-1000\lambda}}{2^4*3^2*5})$

$e^{-1767\lambda}\lambda^8(2^{11}*5^{9}\lambda^2e^{-2000\lambda}+\frac{2^{17}*5^{20}\lambda^6e^{-1000\lambda}}{3^2})$

Factor out constants:
$2^{11}*5^9e^{-1767\lambda}\lambda^8(\lambda^2e^{-2000\lambda}+\frac{2^{6}*5^{11}\lambda^6e^{-1000\lambda}}{3^2})$

Drop constants:
$e^{-1767\lambda}\lambda^8(\lambda^2e^{-2000\lambda}+\frac{2^{6}*5^{11}\lambda^6e^{-1000\lambda}}{3^2})$


    
**2d.** Let $K = \int L(\lambda; y)p(\lambda) d\lambda$ be the integral of the proportional posterior.  Then the proper posterior density, i.e. a true density integrates to 1, can be expressed as $p(\lambda \mid y) = \frac{L(\lambda; y)p(\lambda)}{K}$.  Compute this posterior density and clearly express the density as a mixture of two gamma distributions. 
   
$K = \int L(\lambda; y)p(\lambda) d\lambda$

$=\int e^{-1767\lambda}\lambda^8(\lambda^2e^{-2000\lambda}+\frac{2^{6}*5^{11}\lambda^6e^{-1000\lambda}}{3^2}) d\lambda$

Proper posterior density:
$p(\lambda \mid y) = \frac{L(\lambda; y)p(\lambda)}{K}$
$= \frac{e^{-1767\lambda}\lambda^8(\lambda^2e^{-2000\lambda}+\frac{2^{6}*5^{11}\lambda^6e^{-1000\lambda}}{3^2})}{\int e^{-1767\lambda}\lambda^8(\lambda^2e^{-2000\lambda}+\frac{2^{6}*5^{11}\lambda^6e^{-1000\lambda}}{3^2}) d\lambda}$

    
**2e.**  Plot the posterior distribution.  Add vertical lines clearly indicating the prior means from each expert.  Also add a vertical line for the maximum likelihood estimate.
